# fail2ban

This repository contains some Fail2Ban actions and filters that I use on my AWS t2.micro instance running Amazon Linux.  Fail2Ban os an open-source project designed to search log files for Failed (or bad) connection attempts and Ban the source IP.  The ban can be temporary or permanent.

These files are all for Fail2Ban version 8 on Amazon Linux 4.9 (based on CentOS 6).
